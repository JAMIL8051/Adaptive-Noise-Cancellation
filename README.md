# Adaptive-Noise-Cancellation

This is a method for detection of faces quickly and accurately in an unconstrained condition. The normalized pixel difference (NPD) has been used as a new feature in images for detection. This NDP is calculated as the difference to sum ratio of two adjacent pixel values. Itâ€™s inspired by the Weber Fraction in experimental psychology. Then a deep quadratic tree is used to learn the optimal subset of the feature and combinations of the subsets from the training images. This is done to simplify the complex manifold of faces to a set of learned rules. As a result, a single soft-cascade classifier was used to handle the unconstrained face detection. Furthermore, the NPD features were efficiently obtained from a look up table, and the detection template could be easily scaled, making run-time of the proposed face detector very fast and realistic.
